# TextJustification
This is the implementation of text justification in python

-> The input files are "magna_carla.txt" and "kubla_kahn.txt" which have to be text justified.
-> The max number of words allowed in the line is 80 for this code. A user can change it to a different value.
-> output.log contains the text justified output and also the cost inccured.
-> The output.log also contains the number of bad lines if any exist.
-> We have used Dynamic Programming for implementing this algo.
